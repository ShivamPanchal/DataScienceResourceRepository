# Automating Distributined Tasks with Ansible in the Cloud
## Busra Koken

In this talk, I made a presentation about how to automate distributed tasks with Ansible in the Cloud. I showed a case study that covers: 

  - creating a Hadoop cluster in the cloud - digitalocean
  - running a Big Data job on the Hadoop cluster
  - destroying the cluster

All above is done with Ansible remotely. 

You can find the project that does the job on Github [here].
