The ``@recurrent`` decorator is used to specify which of the arguments to the method are sequences to iterate over, what is returned when the method is called and which of those returned values correspond to recurrent states. Its relationship with the inputs and outputs arguments to the ``@application`` decorator is as follows:\n",
