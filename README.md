# DataScienceResourceRepository
A centralized resource of all repositories related to data science.

This is a collection of other repositories on GitHub that contain tutorials about a massive array of data science tutorials.



### Disclaimer: I didn't make any of these tutorials (as of 10/23). I'm just restructuring them to make a more organized repostiory.
I might rename the repository, but will not remove any author attributions!
